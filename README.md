A simple DOS graphics library. 

Everything is made exclusively using programs in DOS created before 1994. 

Unfortunately, I don't have a DOS PC (they're expensive now!), so I've been developing this in DOSBox. I have no idea if this is working on actual DOS systems, but it should :P

Expect more documentation soon!

## This is EXPERIMENTAL!!!
This is an early version of this library. Don't expect anything to be functional.

I'm also a beginner at C. 

## Installation

## BUILDING:

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! 

If you have a DOS PC, testing is greatly appreciated!
