A simple DOS graphics library. 

Everything is made exclusively using programs in DOS created before 1994. 

Unfortunately, I don't have a DOS PC (they're expensive now!), so I've been developing this in DOSBox. I have no idea if this is working on actual DOS systems, but it should :P

Expect documentation soon!

## This is VERY EXPERIMENTAL!!!
This is a very, very, very early version of this library. Don't expect anything to be functional.

I'm also a beginner at C. 

## Installation

See [Getting Started](https://draw13.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/).

## BUILDING:

See [Building From Source](https://draw13.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#building-from-source).

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

If possible, I'd like for you to do all of your programming and development in DOS. That's my challenge for this project. 

If you have a DOS PC, testing is greatly appreciated!
