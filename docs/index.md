# Draw13 Documentation

Draw13 is a simple graphics library for DOS. Everything in this project is coded entirely in DOS using tools released before 1994. 
The 13 in Draw13 is short for Mode 13h. 
Why? Because it's fun. 

See [Getting Started](getting_started.md) to install Turbo C and the library.
See [Tutorial 1](tutorials/tutorial1.md) for basic use instructions.

## Goals

I want this project to provide an easy to use framework to help people start developing graphical programs for DOS. 
Eventually, I may add support for basic game functionalities so that basic games can be made. 

## The Docs

I've created these docs not only to help with using Draw13, but also to provide info for anyone who is interested in DOS programming. 
Want something to be added to the docs? Open an issue! 

Everything is WIP.
