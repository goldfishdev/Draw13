# Draw13 Documentation

Draw13 is a simple graphics library for DOS. The 13 in Draw13 is short for Mode 13h. 

Everything in this project is coded entirely in DOS using tools released before 1994. 
Why? Because it's fun. 

These docs aren't updated often, so the repository is probably ahead of what's here.

See [Getting Started](getting_started.md) to install Turbo C and the library.
See [Tutorial 1](tutorials/tutorial1.md) for a basic project setup tutorial.

I've created these docs not only to help with using Draw13, but also to provide info for anyone who is interested in DOS programming. 
Want something to be added to the docs? Open an issue! 

Everything is WIP.
